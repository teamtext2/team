# Text2 Starter UI (Modern Componentized Template)

This is a lightweight starter template built to match the dark, app-grid UI
you provided. It's organized using a modern folder layout (components, assets, utils)
so multiple developers can work on it easily.

## Quick start
- Static preview: open `index.html` in the repo root in your browser (works without Node).
- Dev server (recommended): if you have Node.js installed:
  1. `npm install`
  2. `npm run dev` (uses Vite)

## Structure
```
text2-app/
├─ public/
├─ src/
│  ├─ assets/styles/
│  ├─ components/
│  └─ utils/
├─ index.html
├─ package.json
└─ README.md
```
